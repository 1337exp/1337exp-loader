Simplify your logistics without overcomplicating your endgame. This mod introduces a straightforward and efficient loader that integrates seamlessly into the game's progression.

The loader unlocks after Turbo Belts, requiring inserters for its creation—ensuring that inserters remain relevant and valuable. By the late game, when energy consumption is measured in gigawatts, the distinction between energy usage by inserters or loaders becomes negligible.

This mod doesn’t provide unfair advantages—it’s designed to complement the natural flow of progression. Just focus on enjoying the art of logistics without unnecessary distractions!
